Prompt: Implement Professional Dark Theme for User Dashboard in AutoForwardX
Objective:
Update and improve the User Dashboard UI to create a sleek, professional, dark-themed interface. The design should be easy to navigate, beginner-friendly, and mobile-responsive. The goal is to have a visually appealing dashboard that maintains a clean and modern professional look with neon accents and subtle animations.

Specific Requirements:
Color Scheme & Theme:

Primary Background: Use a dark gray (#121212 or #181818) for the background.

Card Backgrounds: Slightly lighter dark gray (#232323) with soft drop shadows to create separation.

Text Color: Use light gray (#E0E0E0) for general text. Important labels or values should be in neon blue (#00B4D8).

Accent Colors: Apply muted neon (light teal, blue) accents for buttons, links, progress bars, and hover effects.

Button Styles:

Use rounded, flat buttons with neon blue hover effects. Buttons should glow subtly on hover and click.

Example CSS for buttons:

css
Copy
Edit
button {
  background-color: #00B4D8;
  color: #FFF;
  border: 2px solid transparent;
  padding: 12px 20px;
  border-radius: 25px;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: bold;
  transition: background-color 0.3s, box-shadow 0.3s;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #007C91;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 180, 216, 0.5);
}
Card Layout & Stats:

Create modular, flat cards with a minimalist style.

Each card should display key stats: Active Sessions, Active Workers, Messages Today, and System Health.

Use progress bars with neon accent colors for CPU, Memory, and Database load. Each card should have a clean layout and subtle shadow on hover for better visual separation.

Side Navigation:

Simplify the sidebar with icons and labels for each section: Dashboard, Sources, Destinations, Forwarding Rules, Logs, etc.

Highlight the active link with a neon underline or background color.

Collapsible sidebar on mobile with clear icons and minimal text.

Example CSS for the sidebar:

css
Copy
Edit
.sidebar-link {
  color: #BBB;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 12px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  transition: background-color 0.3s, color 0.3s;
}

.sidebar-link:hover, .sidebar-link.active {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #00B4D8;
}
Typography:

Use modern fonts like Poppins or Roboto for readability.

Headers should be bold with neon accents for important statistics or section titles.

Example for headings:

css
Copy
Edit
h1, h2, h3 {
  font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
  color: #FFF;
  font-weight: bold;
}

h3 {
  color: #00B4D8; /* Neon accent for headers */
}
Activity Feed & Status:

Activity Feed should display recent system events (e.g., session starts, errors) with clear icons and colored backgrounds (green for success, red for errors).

System Status should show as operational, healthy, or warning with a color-coded label (e.g., green for healthy, red for warning).

Use subtle animations on activity feed items as they appear.

Example CSS for activity items:

css
Copy
Edit
.activity-item.success {
  background-color: #004C61;
  color: #FFF;
}

.activity-item.error {
  background-color: #D32F2F;
  color: #FFF;
}
Layout & Spacing:

Ensure consistent spacing around components for visual balance.

Increase padding and margin around cards, buttons, and the sidebar to create clear separation between elements.

Mobile Responsiveness:

Ensure that the sidebar collapses or transforms into a floating menu on mobile.

Content sections should stack vertically on smaller screens.

Cards and buttons should resize appropriately for different screen sizes using flexbox or grid layout.

Hover Effects & Animations:

Apply subtle glowing effects to buttons and links on hover.

Use smooth transitions for progress bars and other changing elements.

Minimal animations are allowed for hover states and active elements.

Deliverables:
Updated User Dashboard UI with the new professional dark theme and minimal animations.

Responsive layout that adapts well to both desktop and mobile views.

Buttons with smooth hover effects and neon accents.

System stats cards with progress bars and clean design.

Sidebar with collapsible functionality and intuitive navigation.

Activity feed and system health with clearly labeled status indicators and event logs.

Additional Notes:
The focus should be on usability while maintaining a sleek, professional aesthetic.

Ensure the UI is beginner-friendly with clear labels and tooltips for key features.
