Prompt: Redesign User Dashboard UI with Clean & Professional Dark Theme
Objective:
Redesign the User Dashboard for AutoForwardX to provide a sleek, professional dark theme that is easy to navigate, mobile-friendly, and beginner-friendly. The dashboard should have minimal animations, clean typography, and easy-to-read statistics while still maintaining a subtle ninja/anime aesthetic for visual appeal.

Key Features to Implement:
Color Scheme & Theme:

Dark Background: Use a dark gray to black background (#121212 or #181818).

Card Backgrounds: Slightly lighter dark gray for cards (#232323 or #333333) with soft drop shadows.

Text: Use white (#E0E0E0) for regular text and light gray for secondary text.

Accents: Neon teal or blue for interactive elements like buttons, active states, and progress bars. Use muted neon colors for a professional look.

Minimal Animations: Avoid excessive animations but use subtle hover effects, glowing buttons, and neon progress bars for interactive elements.

Main Navigation Sidebar:

Simplified Icons for sections like Dashboard, Sources, Destinations, Forwarding Rules, Logs, and Settings.

Hover Effects: Highlight the active section with a neon underline or background color change (e.g., #00B4D8).

Collapsible Sidebar for mobile view with icons and labels clearly visible.

Dashboard Header:

Display the user's name with a welcome message (e.g., "Welcome back, [Username]!").

Display the system health (CPU, RAM, Database load) with neon progress bars or percentage indicators.

Show Active Sessions, Active Workers, and Messages Today in modular card-style widgets with progress bars.

System Health & Activity Feed:

System Health Cards: Include metrics for CPU, Memory, and Database Load using smooth progress bars with neon accents.

Recent Activity Feed: Show recent system activities (e.g., user registration, session started, etc.) in a simple vertical feed with subtle icons.

Status Indicators: Display system status such as Operational or Warning in a clean, readable format.

Card-Based Layout for Stats:

Active Sessions, Active Workers, Messages Today in modular cards with rounded corners, soft shadows, and glowing highlights on hover.

Use simple charts or progress bars to show the number of messages forwarded or workers processing data.

Cards should have titles, values, and small icons related to the content (e.g., a user icon for active users).

Mobile Responsiveness:

Ensure the layout is responsive, with a collapsible sidebar and stacked content sections on smaller screens.

Use flexbox/grid layout for components to ensure they adjust automatically for tablet/mobile screens.

Interactive Buttons & Controls:

Flat buttons with neon hover effects (e.g., glow when clicked, color change on hover).

Use rounded corners for all buttons to keep the modern look.

Include interactive modals for settings, session management, and logs with a clean, minimalist design.

Footer & Session Controls:

Add a simple footer with important session controls like Pause Session, Stop Session, or Add New Session.

Include clear action buttons that are easy to find and intuitive.

Typography & Icons:

Use modern, readable fonts (e.g., Poppins, Roboto, Inter) with clear font sizes for headings, body text, and labels.

Icons should be minimal, simple, and intuitive with consistent sizes.

Icons should be used sparingly and should not distract from the key content.

Expected Deliverables:
Updated User Dashboard UI with the new professional dark theme.

Mobile-responsive layout that looks great on both desktops and mobile devices.

Improved Navigation with collapsible sidebar, cleaner layout, and consistent color theme.

Subtle Animations for buttons and interactive elements, such as glowing effects on hover.

User Health Dashboard displaying system status, memory, CPU, and database health with smooth progress bars.

Activity Feed that shows recent actions or events in a clean, easy-to-follow feed.

Fully Integrated Frontend that communicates with backend (no broken links or empty sections).

Additional Notes:
The layout should prioritize user clarity and ease of access to essential features such as session management, system health, and recent activity.

The user experience should be intuitive with easy-to-understand icons and clear call-to-action buttons.

Ensure that no distracting animations are present; we want smooth transitions and hover effects, but not flashy or overpowering designs.
