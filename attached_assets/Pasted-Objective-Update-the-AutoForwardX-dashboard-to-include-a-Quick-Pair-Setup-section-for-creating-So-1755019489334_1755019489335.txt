Objective:
Update the AutoForwardX dashboard to include a "Quick Pair Setup" section for creating Source–Destination pairs on one screen without going through multiple popups.

Design Requirements:

Keep the dark theme, typography, and card style exactly the same as the current dashboard.

Insert a new Quick Pair Setup card directly below the "Welcome back, admin!" header and above the "System Health" & "Activity Feed" cards.

Inside the Quick Pair Setup card, include:

Dropdown: Select Source Channel (list fetched from existing sources API, with an inline "Add New" option that opens the existing Add Source modal).

Dropdown: Select Destination Channel (list fetched from existing destinations API, with an inline "Add New" option that opens the existing Add Destination modal).

Dropdown: Pair Type (Channel → Channel, Channel → Group, Group → Channel, Group → Group).

Numeric input: Priority (1–10).

Toggle: Advanced Settings (expands inline to show filters and editing options, reusing existing backend logic).

Primary action button: Create Pair (calls the same backend endpoint as the current "Create Mapping" flow).

Keep form fields inline and compact to avoid taking too much vertical space.

Show success/error toast notifications using the existing notification system after creating a pair.

Add a Pairs Overview table below the form showing existing mappings (Source, Destination, Type, Status, Actions). The Actions should have Edit & Delete buttons that reuse existing modals & API endpoints.

Backend Requirements:

Reuse existing backend endpoints for adding sources, adding destinations, and creating mappings.

API calls should be triggered on "Create Pair" without requiring page reload.

Ensure form dropdowns dynamically fetch available sources/destinations from the backend on page load.

Keep backend validation & error handling intact.

Style:

Same colors, padding, font sizes, and rounded corners as the current UI.

Use subtle glowing blue accents for buttons and highlights to match the dashboard’s theme.

No new CSS frameworks — reuse existing styles to avoid design inconsistencies.
