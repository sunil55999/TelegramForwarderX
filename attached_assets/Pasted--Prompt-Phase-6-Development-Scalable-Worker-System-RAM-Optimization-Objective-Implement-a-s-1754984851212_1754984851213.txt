ðŸš€ Prompt: Phase 6 Development â€“ Scalable Worker System & RAM Optimization

Objective:
Implement a scalable, intelligent worker system for AutoForwardX that dynamically distributes user sessions and forwarding tasks across multiple VPS-based worker nodes. Ensure high availability, optimized RAM usage, and premium user prioritization.

Key Functional Areas:

Dynamic Worker Management

Enable main server to register, monitor, and deregister worker nodes via a secure channel (WebSocket/Socket.IO or REST-based heartbeat).

Each worker node reports:

Worker ID

Total RAM & current usage

Number of active sessions

Ping latency

Load score (RAM weight + CPU usage)

Workers must auto-reconnect on disconnection/crash.

Load-Based Session Assignment

When a user starts forwarding:

Select the most appropriate worker based on available RAM and load score.

Premium users get top-priority placement (lowest-latency, lowest-load worker).

Free users are assigned to idle or less powerful workers.

Allow admin to set thresholds (e.g., max 1.5GB RAM per worker or 20 sessions max).

Fallback Logic & Overflow Control

If no workers have available capacity:

Queue free-user sessions with delayed start.

Premium sessions trigger overflow to a new worker instance if available.

Implement notification system (email/Telegram alert) to admin when scaling is required.

RAM-Efficient Session Design

Clients remain connected but idle (no polling when idle).

Reuse clients instead of restarting Telethon sessions unless reauth is required.

Use psutil (or similar) to track session-wise RAM usage.

Implement a memory cleanup task every X minutes to unload inactive sessions.

Worker-Server Communication

Worker registers itself with main server and gets assigned tasks.

Tasks may include:

Add/start/stop user session

Update filters/rules

Restart failed session

Return RAM usage

Use task acknowledgment to confirm success/failure.

Worker Crash Handling

Main server must detect when a worker:

Is unresponsive for >15s

Sends corrupted data

Exceeds memory limits

Auto-assign affected user sessions to available workers or notify admin if none available.

Admin Tools & Monitoring

Admin dashboard should show:

List of workers with RAM/session usage

Assigned users and status (Active/Idle/Failed)

Start/Stop worker manually

Reassign sessions manually

Add/remove worker server keys

Real-time session RAM profiling per user

Code Requirements

Use environment variables or auth tokens for secure worker-server comms

Modular, extendable worker manager module

Logging with timestamps, worker IDs, and task context

Deliverables:

Fully functional worker manager on main server

Independent, RAM-aware worker client that can run on multiple VPSs

Automatic and manual worker assignment logic

Admin dashboard updates showing session & worker health

RAM cleanup & optimization system
