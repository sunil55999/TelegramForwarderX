Develop Phase 3 of AutoForwardX according to the system roadmap.

Objective:
Extend the basic forwarding engine with Advanced Editing, Monitoring, and Update Handling features. Ensure these features are fully configurable via the admin interface and persist after restarts.

Phase 3 Features to Implement:

Message Update Syncing

If a message in the source is edited, automatically update the forwarded copies in all destinations.

Updates must be applied within 5 seconds of detection.

Maintain original forwarded formatting while applying the updated content.

Message Deletion Syncing

If a message is deleted from the source, delete it from all destinations (configurable on/off).

Advanced Editing Rules

Support regex-based find/replace before forwarding.

Example: Replace buy with BUY ðŸš€ in all forwarded messages.

Allow multiple regex rules to run in sequence.

Multi-Layer Filtering

Combine keyword filtering with message type filtering.

Example: Forward only text messages containing forex.

Message Preview & Delay

Add an option to delay forwarding by a set time (e.g., 5â€“60 seconds).

Optionally allow admin to approve/reject messages during this delay (via inline buttons).

Channel/Group Monitoring Dashboard

Show live status:

Number of messages processed in last hour/day.

Number forwarded, filtered, blocked.

Error counts.

Display as a Telegram admin panel command (/stats).

Admin Commands for Phase 3 Features

/seteditrule â€” Add regex replacement rule.

/listeditrules â€” Show all rules.

/removeeditrule â€” Delete a rule.

/syncupdates on|off â€” Enable/disable update syncing.

/syncdeletes on|off â€” Enable/disable deletion syncing.

/setdelay â€” Set forwarding delay in seconds.

/approve / /reject â€” Approve or reject delayed messages.

/stats â€” Show system stats.

Persistent Storage Upgrade

Store all regex rules, sync settings, delay time, and stats in persistent storage.

Ensure no loss of data after restart.

Development Notes:

Maintain clean modular code: separate message handling, filtering, and storage logic.

Optimize so added features do not cause delays in normal forwarding.

All changes must be backward-compatible with Phase 2.

Log all message updates, deletions, and approval actions.
