Prompt: Redesign User Dashboard UI for AutoForwardX
Objective:
Redesign the User Dashboard for AutoForwardX to create a beginner-friendly, mobile-responsive, dark-themed interface with a touch of anime/ninja aesthetics. The dashboard should be visually engaging, easy to navigate, and optimized for users to quickly access and manage their Telegram forwarding system.

Key Requirements:
Color Scheme & Theme

Dark Theme: Use dark gray backgrounds with bright neon highlights (e.g., neon blue, purple, teal).

Anime/Ninja-Inspired Elements: Incorporate sleek, glowing accents, minimalistic icons, and subtle animations for a smooth and dynamic user experience.

Typography: Use a clean, modern font (e.g., Poppins, Roboto) with bold headings and bright, readable text.

Main Navigation Sidebar

The sidebar should include key sections like Dashboard, Sources, Destinations, Forwarding Rules, Logs, and Settings.

The sidebar should be collapsible on mobile screens.

Use icon-based navigation with smooth hover animations (e.g., glowing icons, ninja star effects).

Active navigation items should have a glowing outline or background.

Dashboard Header

Welcome message at the top, with the user’s name and a greeting (e.g., “Welcome back, [Username]!").

System health section: Show RAM usage, CPU usage, and Database load with neon progress bars.

Active Sessions & Workers: Display key statistics in cards with neon-colored numbers.

Recent Activity Feed

Display recent system activities (e.g., new users, active sessions).

Use neon-tinted notification cards with smooth animation for new updates.

Color-code activities: Green for success, Red for errors, Blue for information.

Footer & Session Controls

Provide session management options at the bottom: Pause/Stop Session, Add New Session, etc.

Buttons should have rounded corners, glowing hover effects, and an anime-inspired background on click.

Mobile Responsiveness

Ensure the layout is fully responsive: collapsible sidebar, stacked content sections.

On mobile, side navigation becomes a sliding panel or collapsible dropdown.

Ensure buttons and cards adjust their size and layout on smaller screens.

Interactive Elements & Animations

Smooth transitions for page loads, hover effects, and clickable buttons.

Subtle animations on session statistics (e.g., values can pulse or glow on update).

Use CSS animations for button hover effects and transitions.

Add a loading spinner or progress bar when data is fetching.

Statistics & Performance Monitoring

Display live data such as the number of active sessions, forwarding tasks, and messages processed today in an interactive dashboard.

Use animated graphs or neon bars for visual performance stats.

User-Friendly Interface

Tooltips: Hover over icons or buttons to show tooltips describing their function (helpful for beginners).

Clear Sectioning: Group related settings and data together for better usability (e.g., Session Management under one section).

Feedback & Notifications: Display success/error pop-ups with glow effects when users complete tasks or make changes.

Accessibility Considerations

Ensure contrast ratios are high enough for accessibility.

Implement keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

Make sure icons and text are sufficiently large for easier reading.

Mobile-first, dark-themed design with neon accents.
